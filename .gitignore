# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data.
# An exception to this rule is a variables file that does not contain secrets,
# such as a terraform.tfvars file used for environment-specific settings.
# Generally, sensitive data should be managed via a secret manager.
#
# If you must commit a tfvars file, add an exception pattern like:
# !terraform.tfvars
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally
# and are not intended for version control.

# Optional: ignore plan files saved before destroying Terraform configuration
# Uncomment the line below if you want to ignore planout files.
# *.tfplan*

# Optional: ignore graph output files generated by `terraform graph`
# *.dot
